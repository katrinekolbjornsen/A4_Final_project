### Summary of the use case / why is this a challenge?

When using building information modelling in projects, workers rely on well performed models in order to efficiently extract the information they need.
To ensure a better quality of the-IFC model, a Python script may be used to control if the structural materials are defined correctly by the structural engineer.


### Who is you tool for?

This use case helps the structural engineer in a project to control their work, and check how well they have defined the structural materials.
When the elements are defined correctly, it makes it easier for all the other disciplinaries in the project to do their job.
For example, the cost estimation, life cycle assessment, and many other analysis may be performed more easily.


### Business and societal value

With better models and an easier work flow, time and money may be saved in the overall project.
This affects not only the structural engineer's company, but all other involved parties.
