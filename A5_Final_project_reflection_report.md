## Feedback 28.11.2022 and plans for future work/reflection

## Group 9 (us)
### Feedback from other groups:
Negative - Unclear what we meant with quality control
Suggestion for future work: what if one beam is of the wrong material? Say one beam among concrete beams - create a tool that notice this.
### Reflection of our own work:
For the future, it would be interesting to expand the script and connect it with a 3D-model program. As the other groups said, it is useful to have a tool that visualizes the output from the script. An idea is to combine the script, 3D-illustrator, and a web page together. That would also help the process of using something a Python consol

## Feedback with other groups
### Group 10
A tool to calculate the dead load of structural elements via a website where you upload your file.
Finds the elements and highlight them in the model and displays information for the selected element in list.
Script in Python, and some visuals in Java.
Good that it illustrates where the element is.
Negative that it only displays information and doesn't give a collective result.
Initially the group wanted to create the menu and visual together, so that you could click on the model and get the information.

### Group 14
Extracts info from IFC model, put into Excel file, orders the elements.
Would like to do more with vector orientation of walls, but did not have time.
Negative - are we sure it extract all of the structural elements - how does it detect it is a structural element or not - 



### Group 21
Tool with density of materials and volume to calculate weight of structure.
Total volume of steel in concrete element, and concrete based on percentage of steel.
Thought about using cross section to calculate total volumes.
Results are presented in Excel.
Idea is to find center of gravity, useful in earthquake calculations.
Negative - would be nice to see the tool in action/understand it more.

### Group 5
Script extract beams properties and create an input file, and web page reads input file and calculates the maximum allowed load for the beam, using the differential equations.
Checks for deflection and stress.
In program you can choose if it is a distributed load or concentrated.
Negative - always assume simply supported, and no visual representation.

## What can the structure groups do next year?
Easy to repeat preveious work:
- global stability
- optimalizing structural elements, and reduce cross sections to reduce cost and increase sustainability
- create a load distribution in color scemene on a 3D model
- script that can detect surrounding elements and the transferring between them
- crash test/check connection of elements
