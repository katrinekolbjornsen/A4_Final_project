## Feedback 28.11.2022 and plans for future work/reflection

## Group 9 (us)
### Feedback from other groups:
Negative - Unclear what we meant with quality control.

Suggestion for future work: what if one beam is of the wrong material? Say one beam among concrete beams - create a tool that notice this.

### Project reflection:
In the process of creating the tool was a shifting process, as we changed our use case a few times. Maybe if the information we were given was more clear, we could have spent more time on one specific use case. This would give us time to create a more advanced tool. Nevertheless, this process made it important to carefully think through the ideas. As the output is pretty basic, it gives great possibilities for future work. We made the decision to produce clean and correct output, and spend more time on this.

For the future, it would be interesting to expand the script and connect it with a 3D-model program. As the other groups said, it is useful to have a tool that visualizes the output from the script. An idea is to combine the script, 3D-illustrator, and a web page together. That would also help the process of using something more user friendly than a Python consol (i.e. Spyder, Visual Studio Code). This would demand more time and knowledge on programming, but we are happy with the foundation that we have built during these weeks. 

#### 1 Process of developing the tool
Regarding information to use in a thesis, none of the group members are doing a programming or any BIM-related work, so this was not relevant to us in that sense.

Although the course is quite open which gives you endless opportunities, it would be good to be given more examples of possible use cases, or at least some more indicators. In the beginning it was hard to understand what could be a possible use case or not, and whether the use case was any good.

The number of tools were ok, more tools could be even more confusing and more time consuming. 

#### 2 Output of the tool
We feel that the tool adresses the use case, but a more simple format for the user's sake (such as a web page) would solve the case better.

We would have loved to model the use case with both a more user friendly platform and with visualizing tools. This could definitely improve the project.

The project was clearly scoped in a way that the future work was stated from the beginning. 

#### 3 Future
The group members are not likely to use OpenBIM tools for their thesis.
In our professional life, we are privileged to be part of major companies which have access to conventional programs with expensive licenses. The chance for us to use OpenBIM tools is small.








## Feedback with other groups
### Group 10
A tool to calculate the dead load of structural elements via a website where you upload your file.
Finds the elements and highlight them in the model and displays information for the selected element in list.
Script in Python, and some visuals in Java.
Good that it illustrates where the element is.
Negative that it only displays information and doesn't give a collective result.
Initially the group wanted to create the menu and visual together, so that you could click on the model and get the information.

### Group 14
Extracts info from IFC model, put into Excel file, orders the elements.
Would like to do more with vector orientation of walls, but did not have time.
Negative - are we sure it extract all of the structural elements - how does it detect it is a structural element or not - 

### Group 21
Tool with density of materials and volume to calculate weight of structure.
Total volume of steel in concrete element, and concrete based on percentage of steel.
Thought about using cross section to calculate total volumes.
Results are presented in Excel.
Idea is to find center of gravity, useful in earthquake calculations.
Negative - would be nice to see the tool in action/understand it more.

### Group 5
Script extract beams properties and create an input file, and web page reads input file and calculates the maximum allowed load for the beam, using the differential equations.
Checks for deflection and stress.
In program you can choose if it is a distributed load or concentrated.
Negative - always assume simply supported, and no visual representation.

## What can the structure groups do next year?
Easy to repeat preveious work:
- global stability
- optimalizing structural elements, and reduce cross sections to reduce cost and increase sustainability
- create a load distribution in color scemene on a 3D model
- script that can detect surrounding elements and the transferring between them
- crash test/check connection of elements
